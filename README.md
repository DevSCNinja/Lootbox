### 1. Smart Contracts <br/>
a. Loot Box Contract:<br/>
Functionality: Handle loot box opening, cosmetic selection based on rarity tiers, updating supplies, and minting cosmetics.
Random Selection Mechanism: Utilize Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for generating a verifiable random number to ensure fairness.
Chainlink Integration: Incorporate Chainlink VRF to request a random number when a loot box is opened, ensuring transparency and security.
Update Supply: Track the supply of each cosmetic item within the contract.<br/>

b. Cosmetic NFT Contract:<br/>
Functionality: Mint NFTs, manage ownership, and support trades/burn.
ERC721 Standard: Follow ERC721 standard for NFT implementation, which ensures compatibility with existing wallets and marketplaces.<br/>


2. ### Backend and Database Management <br/>

a. Database for Cosmetics:<br/>
Store cosmetics details such as rarity, total supply, attributes, etc., in a centralized database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
Synchronize the defined supply counts with the smart contract during initialization.<br/>

b. Backend Service:<br>
Manage user interactions, handle loot box opening requests, and query cosmetics data.
Serve metadata for cosmetic NFTs (JSON files detailing item attributes, images).


3. ### User Interface and Experience <br/>
a. Instantaneous UX:<br/>
Implement asynchronous calls with loading indicators to provide real-time feedback while interacting with the blockchain.
Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to connect the frontend to the blockchain and handle wallet operations.<br/>

b. Equip/Unequip Mechanism:<br/>
Provide UI components for equipping and unequipping cosmetics.
Interact with a specialized smart contract that links base character NFTs with cosmetic NFTs.
