1. Smart Contracts
a. Loot Box Contract:

Functionality: Handle loot box opening, cosmetic selection based on rarity tiers, updating supplies, and minting cosmetics.
Random Selection Mechanism: Utilize Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for generating a verifiable random number to ensure fairness.
Chainlink Integration: Incorporate Chainlink VRF to request a random number when a loot box is opened, ensuring transparency and security.
Update Supply: Track the supply of each cosmetic item within the contract.

b. Cosmetic NFT Contract:

Functionality: Mint NFTs, manage ownership, and support trades/burn.
ERC721 Standard: Follow ERC721 standard for NFT implementation, which ensures compatibility with existing wallets and marketplaces.


2. Backend and Database Management
a. Database for Cosmetics:

Store cosmetics details such as rarity, total supply, attributes, etc., in a centralized database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
Synchronize the defined supply counts with the smart contract during initialization.
b. Backend Service:

Manage user interactions, handle loot box opening requests, and query cosmetics data.
Serve metadata for cosmetic NFTs (JSON files detailing item attributes, images).


3. User Interface and Experience
a. Instantaneous UX:

Implement asynchronous calls with loading indicators to provide real-time feedback while interacting with the blockchain.
Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to connect the frontend to the blockchain and handle wallet operations.
b. Equip/Unequip Mechanism:

Provide UI components for equipping and unequipping cosmetics.
Interact with a specialized smart contract that links base character NFTs with cosmetic NFTs.
